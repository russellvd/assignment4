ASSIGNMENT 3

How to Run :
To run our scene, the command is in the form: programname path-to-scenegraph 
    => .\Scenegraphs.exe .\scenegraphmodels\scene.txt    

Important files:
scene.txt --> the composite scene that holds all components joined together 
drone.txt --> the drone scenegraph
drone-animations.txt --> the drone scenegraph with attatched transformation & rotate nodes for animation logic. 
RotateTransform.h -> added & expanded the logic to include turns, updates, and directionality for animation logic
View.cpp -> added animation functions & logic

Work split:
All work was split evenly - we both met up in person nearly all sessions and pair programmed.
